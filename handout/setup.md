# Setup: Die sieben Schulen der TDD

Please create a local setup to be able to work with during the complete workshop.
You can bring and follow using your choice of programming language and tooling.
We provide two opinionated example-setups for Typescript and Java. 
If none of the above works for you, please use [https://beta.cyber-dojo.org/creator/home](https://beta.cyber-dojo.org/creator/home) as a fallback. 

## Description
Regardless of the kata and the flow of the dojo, create a starting point that meets all the following points, if applicable:
- Compiler
- Build tool
- Git
- Base project with main function and necessary dependencies for unit tests as well as an initial git branch e.g. main
- On the command line the base project can be built, tested and started via calls to the base project
- IDE with loaded, error-free base project
- Working functions in the IDE with the base project: build, test, start project
